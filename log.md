# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 27 January, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a Google Keep clone following the [JavaScript bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/g/gjavascript) on Scrimba. I first listened to what functionalities needed to be implemented, tried to do it on my own and then watched the guy code. I refactored my code afterwards if I saw he had a better or more efficient way of doing things.

**Thoughts**: I need to study a bit more of CSS. That's what I struggled with the most.
